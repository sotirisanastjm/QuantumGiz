## 🎯 About This Project

This store was built as part of a learning journey into **React**, **React Router**, and **React Context/API** while implementing typical e‑commerce functionality:

- **Product listing** with images, names, and prices  
- **Product detail** pages  
- **Shopping cart** with add/remove items functionality  
- **Cart summary** and checkout placeholder  
- **Responsive design** for desktop and mobile

It demonstrates creating a structured React app, modular components, and managing shared state in a medium‑scale project.
